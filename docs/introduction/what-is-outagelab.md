# What is OutageLab?

OutageLab is a platform for remotely injecting application errors into running services to simulate outages. This helps dev teams proactively validate and improve their resilience, observability, and incident response practices.

## The problem

Too often, we wait for outages to hit to find out how our systems will fail. Even if we anticipate issues and implement graceful fallback mechanisms and alert notifications, these are particularly hard to test because we lack effective ways to simulate failure conditions in a production-like environment.

When outages happen, tensions run high. Urgency demands immediate resolution, not casual inspection of how the broader system is impacted. Wouldn't it be great if we had low-pressure time to test our system's failure behaviors and improve on them? How much better off could we be when a real outage hits?

## How OutageLab helps

## What makes OutageLab different

Unlike most other chaos testing tools, OutageLab works at the application level, not the infrastructure level. This makes it easier for developers to set up and to get started with chaos testing. This also allows greater control in the kinds of failures you can simulate and the conditions in which they occur.
